<h3>Algorithm Choice</h3>
<blockquote cite="https://www.techhouse.org/~mdp/midpoint/oriented1.php">There are formulas for the area of a triangle in terms of the coordinates of the vertices that automatically give the algebraic area. For example,
    to find the algebraic area of a triangle with first vertex at (0, 0), second vertex at (a, b) and third vertex at (c, d), we may use the formula (1/2)(ad - bc). This will be positive if the slope d/c of the line from (0, 0) through (c, d) is greater than the slope b/a of the line from (0, 0) through (a, b), since d/c > b/a implies that ad > bc and ad - bc > 0. 
   In terms of vectors, if the line along (a, b) rotates in a counterclockwise direction to get to the line along (c, d), then the triangle from (0, 0) to (a, b) to (c, d) has positive area, and if it rotates in a clockwise direction, the algebraic area of the triangle is negative.
